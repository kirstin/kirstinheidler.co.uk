# Practice Groups and Workshops


>_Peace starts with each and everyone of us right now._  

Practice groups are a way of practicing and integrating what we know on a cognitive level. Together with others we can face the things we find challenging and be held in presence and compassion.


I offer regular open practice groups:  

- **Conflict Practice Group:** Usually on the first Saturday of the month. More information and sign up [here](https://nvc-uk.com/practice-group/conflict-facilitation-practice-group/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
