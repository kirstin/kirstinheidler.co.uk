# Individuals

### Life matters:
- Do you feel overwhelmed or just need someone to talk to?
- Are you struggling with someone in your life and are you longing for respect and care in your relationship?  
- Do you feel you have to be perfect while sometimes feeling hollow or completely depleted?  
- Do your children drive you crazy or have they turned away from you?  
- Do you long for your partner to just get you?

I am happy to offer a compassionate and safe space for exploring the difficult and sometimes painful matters of life. Whether it is conflicts with family, friends or at work; the challenges (polyamous) relationships throw at you or dysfunctional patterns you find yourself in because of fear, shame or trauma:  
_I can be present with you and offer guidance in your process._

### Leadership matters
- Would you like to be able to communicate in a way that truly brings others on board?
- Do you feel like people disempower themselves in your presence?
- Do you want to learn how to effect change for the better in your organisation without having the structural power?

Being in a position of leadership or taking leadership in a specific area comes with its own set of challenges. While taking that position, many eyes are on you and continuously holding the whole can become challenging. I can help you communicate more clearly, oriented towards vision and purpose. I can help you meet those you lead or are aiming to lead with enough curiosity and acceptance so that magic can happen. Being connected and approachable while at the same time being focused on purpose and having clear discernment are not mutually exclusive and I can help you embody that.
