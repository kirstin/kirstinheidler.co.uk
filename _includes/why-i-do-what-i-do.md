# Why I do What I do

I believe in order to make anything we do in the direction of change sustainable (whether it is action to stop wrongs or constructive action to build the future we want to see), we need a supportive culture. The culture we are currently living in is supporting the destruction and depletion of our planet. It also supports violent ways of relating with ourselves and each other, perpetuating pain and suffering.
  **Therefore, we need cultural change and that is what I am working towards.**

Nonviolent Communication is a spiritual practice, as meditation can be called a spiritual practice. It's about observing ourselves, other human beings, our relationships with them and communication with ourselves and them.  
NVC puts connection first. This allows people to understand each other at the heart level, making the flow of gifts, of giving and receiving, natural.  
With this NVC has a radical potential to bring about change, as it questions currently dominant cultural norms.
