## Vision

Our world is rapidly changing and we need to find ways of engaging uncertainty and fear.   
As we face finitude and crisis, I want us to be able to retain our ability to cooperate.  
I want us to be able to hold love for one another, not succumbing to fear, othering, hatred and violence.

For this we need a culture which supports peace.
