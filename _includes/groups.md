# Groups

- Do you anticipate that conflict might tear you apart or are you already experiencing conflict?
- Would you like to find ways of supporting togetherness and engaging conflict effectively?
- Do you want to find ways of leaving society's disfunctional default solutions behind and creating ways of being and working together that support your vision?
- Do you long for accompanyment along the way from someone who isn't as closely involved?

For groups who are working or living together (or intending to do so), I offer different packages depending on what you need.   
I am able to support you with existing conflicts, help you shape systems to hold you in the future, or work with you to increase harmony and build a shared vision.
