# Relationship

- Do you long for togetherness with another person, but again and again you end up in arguments or disconnection?
- Is there jealousy you don't know how to be with that is eating up your relationship?
- Do you feel desperate and sometimes think it's impossible to agree on something together?

Whether you are in an intimate relationship, a friendship, polyamorous, neighbourly or in family relationships, sometimes these relationships can become painful or are outright disfunctional. As human beings we can only fully become ourselves in relationship with others. Relationships are both the biggest threat to safety at times and the greatest window for healing.  
I can help restore connection, understanding and trust. It does not always happen quickly and the process can feel intense. If both (all) of you want it, I can facilitate the dialogue between you.

I have personal experience with being in polyamorous relationships. I want to offer my experience, skills and insights for people people being in (or open to) consensual, intimate and caring connection with multiple people. My experience tells me that these relationships can bring out a lot and have a lot of potential for personal and collective healing of past traumas. At the same time our own traumas sometimes get in the way and block us from having the connection and intimacy we long for.
I'd be honored to accompany you and offer empathy as well as work with you on shifting communication patterns.
