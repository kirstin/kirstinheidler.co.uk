# Relationship

- Do you long for togetherness with another person, but again and again you end up in arguments or disconnection?
- Would you like the pain that's in you to be heard and understood by the other person?
- Do you feel desperate and sometimes think it's impossible to agree on something together?

Whether you are in an intimate relationship, a friendship, polyamorous, neighbourly or in family relationships, sometimes these relationships can become painful or are outright disfunctional. Still they are important for our lives. I can help restore connection, understanding and trust. If both (all) of you want it, I can facilitate the dialogue between you.

I have personal experience with being in polyamorous relationships and can offer coaching and guidance for people being in (or open to) intimate and caring connection with multiple people.
