I started my journey to learn about feelings, recover my full authenticity and reconnect with my vulnerability when I was 15. Years later - when I was 23 - <dfn>Nonviolent Communication</dfn>[^1] began to give me the tools to do this in a more deliberate way and it connected me with others on the same journey.

Still, from time to time I get the feedback that I come across as if "I know it all". Or people feel as if the only way to be in conversation with me, is to agree with me. Or people are confused or even shocked by the seeming confidence I bring to things, sometimes even when it turns out that I don't know exactly.

There is a painful conundrum for me in this. On the one hand I long for connection and I want others to feel the respect and care I have for them. It also pains me to hear that they are feeling as if I was putting them down, as if they don't know or aren't smart enough. On the other hand I want to trust that there is space form me and what I have can be a valuable maybe even unique contribution. It's a mixture of on the one hand authentic expression and sometimes even meaning or mattering. 

In many ways it would be too easy to put all of this down to the "projections of the other person, who is having a issue with feeling worthless and  inferior, finding in me someone to blame for their pain of not finding their voice". While some of what is happening may be explained by what the other person is bringing to the situation, I also want to look at: what is it that I _am_ doing that might be contributing to this?

As a child and teenager vulnerability was not safe. I was judged for many things and there was nobody I felt safe enough with to share anything about what was going on in me. The loneliness goes deep, and hence - I am assuming - my defenses hardened to almost imprenetrable thickness. I learned to hide my vulnerability by "pretending" to not feel, and seeming confident. My intellect and ability to talk was one of the few things I was regularly appreciated for by the adults in my life. I honed this skill and made it my strongest defence. Deep down there are parts of me who don't trust that there is space for me and that I am welcome. On other levels I do trust that I have space and that I am wanted by the world.

Over the years I have worked a lot on the patterns of shame that I have developed. And yet I can see how it still plays out and can come out in particular in intimate relationships. Instead of being vulnerable and humble I can seem as if I portray myself as superior and others can feel intimidated and small. In many ways this strategy is working very well for protecting me from feeling the vulnerability. However, it also alienates and separates me from the people I love most. 

Because of the loneliness I feel, I struggle to feel the company of others, in particular in these matters of shame. I am willing to unfold them - in many ways I _long_ to unfold them - but I feel so vulnerable and fragile, that I struggle to trust the other will hold me with gentleness and care. I am prone to hear almost anything as judgement, giving moralistic value to anything I say or do. And deep down I worry about losing the relationship, because the other evaluates me as deficient or lacking, irredeemably broken. 

The grandiosity I sometimes go to only covers up the pain and shame.

So can I conquer my vulnerability with gradiosity? - No, not really. It stays, just others might get fooled and hence I might even propagate some of the shame I feel. Very far from what I long for.

What is the alternative?  
I long and need to be held. And I need people who are willing to spend this time on me and hold me with gentleness in the fire and excruciating pain of shame. The process to get there isn't always straightforward.

I am reminded also of encounters and experiences with a famous <abbr title = "Nonviolent Communication"> NVC </abbr> trainer.

Rosenberg that describes principles, attitudes and practical methods for communicating in a way that is more likely to lead to hearful connection between people.
