When we stop resisting, it’s not that we let the anxiety fuelled thoughts run through our mind as much as they want. 
You have every reason to stop the thoughts that are going through your mind and choose what you want to be there. You have the power to do this, and if you put your will to it, nothing can stop you. 
However, this does not mean resisting any of the sensations! When anxiety grips you and your heart starts racing, you feel tension or pain in your body - roll with it. Resisting the sensations can only make them worse and will not add anything to your wellbeing and certainly it will not shorten the time you have these sensations. In fact, any resistance you hold towards the sensations is likely to perpetuate them for longer in your body.
So let it go…lean into the racing heart…lean into the tension… and as you allow them and meet them with welcome, you will notice something relaxing - and if it doesn’t, this is because you are adding thoughts again and probably simply wanting this to go away (or worried it will not stop), which is yet another from of resistance. 
Forgive whatever resistance may come up in you. 
Nothing can have any lasting effect on your mind, unless you perpetuate it.
