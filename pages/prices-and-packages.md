# Financial Transparency and Gift Economy
I love what I do and I love helping people. At the same time I need to feed my family, pay our living expenses and the expenses for running my business. That is why I'm asking for money.

This section is meant to make transparent the money I need each month as well as how much I have received. When I receive more than I need to meet immediate needs, I can give more of my work for lower prices or free, to those who have little financial resources.

Whenever you give me money please consider these different amounts: 
- how much you want to give
- how much you can give

[**Please be in touch with me to pay the lower of the two amounts.**](#contact)
