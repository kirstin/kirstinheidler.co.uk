Nonviolent Communication is a set of tools and principles that anchors you in the now, and allows true communication and natural giving between human beings to happen joyfully.

Learn about the four steps of NVC: Observation, Feeling, Need, Request.

How to listen empathically, what is empathy, and what not.

After this course you will be able to distinguish:
- Observations form judgements and interpretations
