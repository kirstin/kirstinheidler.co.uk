However, if you don't consent, we may not be able to provide our services to you.  We will only use your personal data for the purpose it was collected.

## Marketing Communications

Our lawful ground of processing your personal data to send you marketing communications is either your consent or our legitimate interests (namely to grow our business).

We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.
